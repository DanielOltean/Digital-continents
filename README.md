Daniel Oltean and Jin Xu, Digital continents: Geographical and socio-economic features of Asia and Europe

===============================================================

This project aims to underline some geographical and socio-economic features of Asia and Europe. Obviously, they are two continents with very different pasts, cultures, resources, and economic potential, but also with many common points.

Their traits are discussed based on the Mondial dataset (University of GÃ¶ttingen) http://www.dbis.informatik.uni-goettingen.de/Mondial/. The information included in this dataset is explored in a non-critical manner, the primary purpose being to use some SQL functions in this specific case.

We use SQL in a Python environment and take profit from Pandas, Seaborn, and Pyplot libraries.
